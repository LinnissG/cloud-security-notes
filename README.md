# Cloud Security Notes – Linniss Guerrier

Welcome to my cloud security and cybersecurity learning repo.  
This is where I keep my notes, mini-labs, and practice projects while I learn.

## Why I'm Learning Cyber & Cloud

- I want to become a **Cloud Security Engineer**.
- I'm currently studying **cybersecurity**, **cloud**, and **project management**.
- This repo shows my progress so I can:
  - Track what I've learned
  - Share it with mentors, teachers, and future employers
  - Build confidence as I grow

## 1. The CIA Triad (Security Basics)

In cybersecurity, we often talk about the **CIA Triad**:

1. **Confidentiality** – Only the right people can access the data.
2. **Integrity** – The data is correct and has not been tampered with.
3. **Availability** – The system and data are available when needed.

Example (Real Life):
- Bank app:
  - Confidentiality: Only you should see your balance.
  - Integrity: Your balance should be accurate.
  - Availability: The app should work when you need it.

## 2. Cloud Security – What It Means

**Cloud security** is about protecting:

- Data stored in the cloud (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.)
- Applications running in the cloud
- Identities and permissions (who can access what)

As I learn, I will add:

- ✔️ Short summaries of topics (IAM, encryption, networking, logging)
- ✔️ Links to labs I complete
- ✔️ Small Python scripts or tools I create

## 3. My Learning Roadmap (High-Level)

- [ ] Basics of networking and security (ports, protocols, firewalls)
- [ ] Identity and Access Management in the cloud
- [ ] Logging and monitoring (CloudTrail, Sentinel, etc.)
- [ ] Simple security tools (log analyzers, alerts, scripts)
- [ ] Larger cloud security projects (later)

Stay tuned — more notes and mini-projects coming soon 😄
